Basic Instructions:

        FROM:        Defines the base image.

        RUN:         Executes commands to install dependencies.

        COPY/ADD:    Copies files from your local machine into the container.

        EXPOSE:      Defines which port the container will listen to.

        CMD:         Defines the command to run when the container starts.

        ENTRYPOINT:  Similar to CMD, but ensures the command is always executed (useful for running services).

        WORKDIR:     Set the working directory for your application inside the container.

Example Dockerfile:

            FROM node:14
            WORKDIR /app
            COPY . .
            RUN npm install
            EXPOSE 3000
            CMD ["npm", "start"]
        
Optimizations:

        - Minimize Layers: Combine commands to reduce image size.

        - Use Multistage Builds: Useful for separating build and runtime environments.

        Example of Multi-Stage Dockerfile:

            # Build Stage
            FROM node:14 AS builder
            WORKDIR /app
            COPY . .
            RUN npm install

            # Runtime Stage
            FROM node:14-slim
            WORKDIR /app
            COPY --from=builder /app .
            EXPOSE 3000
            CMD ["npm", "start"]
