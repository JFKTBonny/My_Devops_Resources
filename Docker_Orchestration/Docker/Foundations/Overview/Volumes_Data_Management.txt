Volumes:

    Volumes are Docker's preferred mechanism for persisting data.

    Docker Volumes are independent of the host filesystem.

   *** To create a volume Use:  docker volume create <name> 

Mounting Volumes:
           docker run -v /host/path:/container/path myapp

Data Persistence:
        - Bind Mounts:      Useful for development (bind a local file or directory to the container).

        - Docker Volumes:   Better suited for production as they are managed by Docker and provide more features (backup, restore, etc.).  

Backup and Restore:

    - Backup data in volumes using:
            docker run --rm -v <volume_name>:/volume -v $(pwd):/backup busybox tar cvf /backup/backup.tar /volume
