Monitoring & Troubleshooting:
Goal: Keep containers healthy and debug when things go wrong.

Key Commands:

        *** docker logs <container_id>:                  View the logs for a container.

        *** docker exec -it <container_id> /bin/bash:     Execute a command in a running container.

        *** docker stats:                                 View resource usage stats for containers.

Monitoring Tools:

        - Prometheus:   Scrapes metrics from containers.

        - Grafana:      Visualizes metrics from Prometheus.

        - cAdvisor:     Collects container metrics.
