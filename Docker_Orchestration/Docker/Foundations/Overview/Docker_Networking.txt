Network Types:

    - Bridge:     Default network driver, connects containers on the same host.

    - Host:       Containers share the hostâ€™s network.

    - Overlay:    Used in Docker Swarm for cross-host communication.

Creating Networks:
        docker network create my_network
        docker run --network my_network --name my_container my_image

Inspect Networks:
        docker network inspect my_network
