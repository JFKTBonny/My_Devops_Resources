Docker Registry & Image Management:
Goal: Store and retrieve Docker images.

    Docker Hub:

            Docker Hub is the default public registry for Docker images.

            Private Registries: 
                You can use your own private registry to store images.

    Pushing and Pulling Images:

            *** docker tag myapp:latest myusername/myapp:v1

            *** docker push myusername/myapp:v1

            *** docker pull myusername/myapp:v1
