Docker Security
Goal: Secure Docker images and containers.

    Security Best Practices:

        *** Use minimal images:                Start with lightweight images like alpine.

        *** Avoid Running as Root:             Always run containers as a non-root user by using the USER directive in your Dockerfile.

        **** Scan Images for Vulnerabilities:  Use docker scan <image> to check for vulnerabilities.
