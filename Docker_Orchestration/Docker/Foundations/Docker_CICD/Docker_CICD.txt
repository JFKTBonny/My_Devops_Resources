Docker in CI/CD
Goal: Automate Docker builds and deployments.

    CI/CD Integration:
        Use Docker with tools like:
            - Jenkins
            - GitLab CI
            - GitHub Actions 
            - CircleCI to automatically build and deploy Docker images.

Example GitHub Actions CI Workflow:

        name: Docker CI

        on:
        push:
            branches:
            - main

        jobs:
        build:
            runs-on: ubuntu-latest
            steps:
            - name: Checkout code
                uses: actions/checkout@v2

            - name: Set up Docker Buildx
                uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v1

            - name: Build and push Docker image
                uses: docker/build-push-action@v2
                with:
                context: .
                push: true
                tags: myusername/myapp:latest
