# Deployment Strategies

Deployment strategies help teams release updates with minimal:
- **downtime**
- **risk**
- **impact on users**

---

### 1. Blue-Green Deployment

- Maintains two identical environments:
  - **Blue**: the current live version
  - **Green**: the new version to be deployed
- Traffic switches to the Green environment after successful testing.
- Enables **instant rollback** by reverting traffic to Blue if issues arise.

---

### 2. Canary Deployment

- Gradually releases the new version to a small subset of users.
- Monitors performance, errors, and user feedback during early exposure.
- If stable, expands the rollout to all users.
- Reduces risk compared to full deployments.

---

### 3. Rolling Deployment

- Incrementally updates application instances one or a few at a time.
- Ensures some instances are always available during deployment.
- Minimizes downtime and supports high-availability environments.

---

### 4. A/B Testing

- Deploys multiple versions of an application to different user segments.
- Collects performance data to determine which version performs better.
- Optimizes user experience before a full rollout.

---

### 5. Feature Flags

- Allows enabling or disabling specific features without redeploying the app.
- Supports **gradual rollouts**, internal testing, and **quick rollbacks**.
- Enables **dark launches**: deploying features in production but keeping them hidden until activated.

---

### 6. Rollback

- Reverts to a previously stable version if issues occur during or after deployment.
- Can be done manually or automatically depending on tooling.
- Works well with strategies like Blue-Green, Canary, or version-controlled deployments.
- Essential for minimizing user impact and restoring service quickly.

### ðŸ“Œ Choosing the Right Strategy

The ideal deployment strategy depends on your:
- **Risk tolerance**
- **Need for user testing and feedback**
- **Ability to monitor and rollback**
- **System architecture and scale**
