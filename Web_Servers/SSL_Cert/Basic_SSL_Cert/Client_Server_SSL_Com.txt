*** SSL Communication Between the Client (Browser) and the Server (Web Server) ***

1. First, the browser contacts the web server and initiates an SSL handshake.
   It also informs the server which cipher (encryption) algorithms it supports.

2. Next, the server responds to the browser.
   It confirms the cipher that will be used and sends a copy of its public certificate to the client.

3. The client (browser) then contacts the Certificate Authority (CA) to authenticate the serverâ€™s certificate.

4. The key exchange begins, and a session key is established.
   This key is generated using the public key from the server and can only be decrypted with the server's private key.

5. Once the session key is established, the client sends a final confirmation to complete the handshake,
   and waits for a final response from the server to confirm the secure connection.

6. Finally, a secure tunnel is established through which encrypted data can be transmitted.
   This is where actual web content can now be exchanged securely.
