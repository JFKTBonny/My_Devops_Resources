A static site deployment can be easy to generate and are far less hassle when 
it comes to security and exploits...
here are the steps to follow:
   1- Edit the default site configuration file: /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf...
   modify its content as below:


            server {
                listen       80;
                server_name  server.yourdomain.com;

                access_log  /var/log/nginx/log/host.access.log  
                combined;

                location / {
                    root   /var/www/html;
                    index  index.html;
                }
            }

    2- If the folder does not exist ,create the /var/www/vhosts directory as follow:
             mkdir -p /var/www/vhosts

    3- Copy your existing website files into /var/www/vhosts directory...

    4- Ensure the files and folders have permissions to be read by nginx user(nginx or www-data):
               chmod -R o+r /var/www/vhosts
               chown -R nginx:nginx /var/www/vhosts

    5- Open your browser and check that it is serving your content...
