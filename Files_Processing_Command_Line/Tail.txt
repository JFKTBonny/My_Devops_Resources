################## Tail Command;

Purpose:
    tail displays the last lines of a file or input â€” commonly used for logs and monitoring.

Key Options:
    -n	Show specific number of lines	-n 20 (last 20 lines)
    -f	Follow new lines as the file grows	-f (live monitor a log file)


Common Usage Examples:
    1. Show the last 10 lines (default)
        tail filename.log

    2. Show the last 50 lines
        tail -n 50 filename.log

    3. Live monitoring a file (great for logs)
        tail -f /var/log/syslog
        (Press Ctrl+C to stop.)


    4. Live monitor + show last 20 lines
        tail -n 20 -f /var/log/syslog

Quick Tips:
    tail -f is your best friend for debugging real-time output.

    Combine with grep to monitor for specific events:
        tail -f logfile.log | grep "ERROR"
