############### Sed Command:

Purpose:
    sed (Stream Editor) is used to search, replace, insert, or delete text in a stream (file or stdin).
    It is fast and acts like a one-line edits without opening a text editor!

Key Concepts :
    Substitute (s) means 	"Search and replace text"...example: s/old/new/
    Delete (d) means	"Delete matching lines"...example:	/pattern/d
    Insert (i) means   "Insert text before a line"...example: 	/pattern/i\ New text


Common Usage Examples:
    1. Simple find and replace
        Replace "apple" with "banana" in the whole file:
            sed 's/apple/banana/' filename
            (only first occurrence per line)

        To replace all occurrences in each line:
            sed 's/apple/banana/g' filename
            (g = global)


    2. Delete lines matching a pattern
        Delete lines containing "DEBUG":
            sed '/DEBUG/d' logfile.txt


    3. Replace text in-place (edit the file directly)
        Modify the original file:
            sed -i 's/foo/bar/g' filename
                -i = in-place edit (be careful!).



    4. Insert or append text
        Insert "HELLO" before any line containing "World":
            sed '/World/i\HELLO' filename


Quick Tips:
    sed reads line-by-line, and applies your rule(s).

    Always quote your sed commands to avoid shell problems.

    sed is perfect for simple automated edits (especially in CI/CD pipelines!).
