######################## Tee Command:

Purpose:
    tee reads input and writes it both to stdout (screen) and a file â€” perfect for logging while seeing output live.

Key Options: 
    -a	Append instead of overwrite	tee -a logfile.txt


Common Usage Examples:
    1. Save and display output
        command | tee output.txt
            Saves output to output.txt
            Still shows output on screen



    2. Append output instead of overwriting
        command | tee -a output.txt

    3. Chain tee in scripts
        Capture logs without losing the ability to watch them:
            my_script.sh | tee script.log


Quick Tips:
    Without -a, tee overwrites the file.

    You can tee into multiple files:
        command | tee file1.txt file2.txt
