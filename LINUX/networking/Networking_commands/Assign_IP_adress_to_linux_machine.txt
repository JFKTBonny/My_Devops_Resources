#### Network Admin/system Admin assigns the IP address to the machines when the Organizations switch 
from dynamic control protocol(dynamic addressing scheme) to static IP adress scheme...
That can be done following the methods or Options  below:
          - Option1: using netplan
          - Option2: using NetworkManager
         
     *** Check which system you are using by running: ls /etc/netplan
          If you see files like 01-netcfg.yaml or 00-installer-config.yaml, you're using Netplan. 

        - Option1: Using Netplan
           - find  your netplan config file:  ls /etc/netplan/   ... 
           - edit your netplan config file:  vim  01-netcfg.yaml (for instance)
           It content should look like below:

            network:
                version: 2
                renderer: networkd
                ethernets:
                    enp3s0:  # <-- this is your network interface, yours might be different (e.g., eth0)
                    dhcp4: no
                    addresses: [192.168.1.100/24]
                    gateway4: 192.168.1.1
                    nameservers:
                        addresses: [8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4]

            - find your interface name by running: ip link            
            - Replace enp3s0 with your interface name 
            - Change the IP, gateway, and DNS as needed...
            - Apply changes by running: sudo netplan apply
            - verify by running: ip a

        - Option2: Using NetworkManager
            - Using nmcli
              1- get your connection name by running: nmcli connection show
              2- set a static IP (replace "YOU_CONN_NAME" and values) in the below command:

              nmcli connection modify "YOUR_CONN_NAME" ipv4.method manual ipv4.addresses 192.168.1.100/24 ipv4.gateway 192.168.1.1 ipv4.dns "8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4"

              3- Bring the connaction down and up by running:

                    nmcli connection down "YOUR_CONN_NAME"
                    nmcli connection up "YOUR_CONN_NAME"

              4- verify by running: ip a
NB: an alternative is to use the graphical interface instead of command line by running:  "nmtui" in the terminal...
