############################ Linux Users ##################################

There are three types of user accounts in Linux operating system:
    - root user
    - system  user
    - regular or normal user 

1. Root user
    The root user is also called as super user. 
    A super user can run any command with out any restrictions. 
    This account gives you the ability to carry out all facets of system administration, including adding accounts, changing user passwords, examining log files, installing software, etc.



2. System user
    The System accounts are needed for the operation of system-specific components like mail accounts and the sshd accounts. 
    Also if we install Apache, it will create a user apache. 
    These kind of users are called as system user.

3. Normal user
These users are created by root user. 
Normal user accounts provide access to the system for users and groups of users. 
These users have limited access to critical system files and directories.

***** Create users:
    Create a user:
    useradd scott

    Assign password to user:
    passwd scott
    
    Create a user with account expiry date:
    useradd -e 2017-04-01 mark

    passwd mark

    Create a user with specific user id:
    useradd -u 504 jones

    Create a user with Specific user id and group id:
    useradd -u 600 -g 504 ford

***** Add a user to multiple groups:
    We can add a user to multiple groups by specifying with group name or group id

    useradd -G dev,qa smith

    id smith
    uid=601(smith) gid=601(smith) groups=601(smith),3460(dev),3461(qa)

    useradd -G 3460,3461 ward

    id ward
    uid=602(ward) gid=602(ward)groups=602(ward),3460(dev),3461(qa)
    Add a user with comments:
    useradd -c"Developer" james

    tail -1 /etc/passwd
    james:x:603:603:Developer:/home/james:/bin/bash
    Add user with home directory:
    useradd -d /home/mydir allen

    tail -1 /etc/passwd
    allen:x:604:604::/home/mydir:/bin/bash


   =========>> useradd options :
            -u user id
            -g primary group id
            -G secondary group id
            -d home directory
            -c comment -s shell
            -s shell


***** Delete users:
    Deleting a existing user:
    userdel allen

    Delete user even if he is still logged in:
    userdel -f jones

    Delete user along with home directory:
    userdel -r mark


***** Modify user properties:
    Changing the home directory of user:
    grep jones /etc/passwd
    jones:x:504:504::/home/jones:/bin/bash

    usermod -d /home/jon jones

    grep jones /etc/passwd
    user8:x:604:604::/home/jon:/bin/bash
    Changing the primary group of a user:

    usermod -g dev ford

    Locking(-L) and Unlocking(-U) users:

    usermod -L scott
    usermod -U scott

    Verify in /etc/shadow file it shows exclamation(!) mark at user name when user locked. After unlock it will disappear.

    usermod -L scott

    cat /etc/shadow | grep scott
    scott:!$1$nAgOX9u$GLtQsaMcMBvlPUPgY.0:17143:0:99999:7:::

    usermod -U scott

    cat /etc/shadow | grep scott
