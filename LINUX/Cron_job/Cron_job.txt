📌 Cron Syntax Breakdown
A basic cron job has the format:


        * * * * *  command-to-be-executed
        │ │ │ │ │
        │ │ │ │ └───── Day of the week (0 - 7) (Sunday = 0 or 7)
        │ │ │ └──────── Month (1 - 12)
        │ │ └──────────── Day of the month (1 - 31)
        │ └──────────────── Hour (0 - 23)
        └──────────────────── Minute (0 - 59)

You can use:

        * for "every value"

        / for intervals (e.g., */5 = every 5 units)

        , to list values

        - to set a range


🔍Example Cron Job: 00 */12 * * 0

        Field	         Value	                  Meaning

        Minute	          00	                 At minute 0
        Hour	         */12	                 Every 12 hours (0 and 12)
        Day of Month	  *	                     Every day
        Month	          *	                     Every month
        Day of Week	      0	                     Only on Sunday


🧠 How It Works:
        Runs twice every Sunday (once at midnight, once at noon).
        Will not run on other days of the week.



💡 Example Use Case
Let's say you're a server admin, and you want to:
Reboot a service or run a script every Sunday morning and afternoon.
