The uniq command is used to filter out or show repeated lines in a file. 
It works best when the input is sorted, because it only removes adjacent duplicates.

     🛠️ Basic Syntax:

uniq [options] [input_file] [output_file]

📌 Common Options:

    -c → Prefix lines by the number of occurrences.

    -d → Show only duplicate lines.

    -u → Show only unique (non-repeated) lines.

    -i → Ignore case when comparing.

    -f N → Ignore first N fields when comparing.

    -s N → Ignore first N characters when comparing.

🧪 Examples:

uniq sorted.txt               # Remove adjacent duplicates
sort file.txt | uniq          # Typical usage: remove all duplicates
uniq -c names.txt             # Count occurrences
uniq -d data.txt              # Show only duplicate lines
uniq -u list.txt              # Show only unique lines
