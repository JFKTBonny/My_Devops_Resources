The paste command is used to merge lines of files horizontally (side by side), 
by default separated with a tab.

🛠️ Syntax:

        paste [options] file1 file2 ...


📌 Common Options:

        -d → Specify a custom delimiter (e.g., comma, colon).

        -s → Paste serially (line after line, not column-wise).

🧪 Examples:

        paste file1.txt file2.txt          # Merge files line by line
        paste -d ',' file1 file2           # Merge with comma as separator
        paste -s file.txt                  # Merge lines into one line
