The sort command is used to arrange lines of text files in a specified order 
(default is alphabetical/lexical order).

🛠️ Basic Syntax:

        sort [options] [file...]

If no file is specified, sort reads from standard input.

📌 Common Options:

        -r → Sort in reverse order.

        -n → Sort numerically (e.g., 2 before 10).

        -k → Sort based on a specific column (e.g., -k2 for second column).

        -u → Unique: Remove duplicate lines.

        -o <file> → Write the output to a file instead of standard output.

🧪 Examples:

        sort file.txt                  # Sort alphabetically
        sort -r file.txt               # Sort in reverse order
        sort -n numbers.txt            # Sort numbers
        sort -k2 data.txt              # Sort by the second column
        sort -u names.txt              # Remove duplicates
