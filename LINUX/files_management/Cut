The cut command is used to extract specific fields or columns from lines of text, 
especially in delimited files (like CSV or tab-separated files).

          🛠️ Basic Syntax:

cut [options] [file...]

           📌 Common Options:

-f → Field number(s) to extract (used with -d).

-d → Delimiter that separates fields (default is tab).

-b → Byte positions (for fixed-width data).

-c → Character positions.

           🧪 Examples:

cut -d ',' -f1 names.csv        # Extract 1st field from CSV
cut -d ':' -f1 /etc/passwd      # Get usernames from passwd file
cut -c1-5 file.txt              # Extract first 5 characters of each line
cut -f2-3 data.txt              # Extract 2nd and 3rd tab-separated fields

******🔸 Pro tip: 
cut is fast and great for simple tasks, but for more complex text processing, 
tools like awk are more powerful.*******
