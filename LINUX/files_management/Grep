The grep command is used to search for patterns (using regular expressions) in files or input.

🛠️ Syntax:

         grep [options] pattern [file...]
         
📌 Common Options:

        -i → Ignore case.

        -v → Invert match (show lines that do not match).

        -r → Recursive search in directories.

        -n → Show line numbers.

        -l → Show only file names with matches.

        -E → Use extended regex (like egrep).

🧪 Examples:

       grep "hello" file.txt                # Find "hello"
       grep -i "error" logs.txt             # Case-insensitive search
       grep -v "done" file.txt              # Show lines not containing "done"
       grep -r "TODO" ./src                 # Search recursively in folder
       grep -n "main" code.c                # Show line numbers with "main"
