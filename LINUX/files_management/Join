The join command is used to combine two files based on a common field (like SQL join).
 Files must be sorted on the join field.

🛠️ Syntax:

join [options] file1 file2

📌 Common Options:

        -1 N → Join on Nth field of file1.

        -2 N → Join on Nth field of file2.

        -t → Specify a delimiter.

        -o → Format output fields.

             🧪 Examples:

join file1.txt file2.txt              # Join on first field (default)
join -1 2 -2 1 f1.txt f2.txt          # Join f1's 2nd field with f2's 1st
join -t ',' file1.csv file2.csv      # Join using comma delimiter
