############################## Linux Processes:

    Linux is a multitasking operating system. 
    Linux creates a process whenever a program is launched, either by user or by OS itself.
    If a process runs and terminates properly, then everything is fine. 
    If not, You need to manage the processes by commands.
    If we would like to get a snapshot of what is currently happening on the system we may use a program called "top".

Types of processes:
    - Foreground: They run on the screen and need input from the user.
    - Background: They run in the background and usually do not need user input.

process management commands:

    To display the currently working processes:
        ps

    Display all processes: ps ax  or   ps -ef  or ps aux
       

   
    Display process by user:   ps -f -u ops
      
    Show process by name:     ps -C metacity
    
    Show process by process id:   ps -f -p 2609,2704,2585
    
    Show process by using grep (searching):  ps -ef | grep "metacity"
    
    Show process by sorting on cpu usage percentage:   ps aux --sort=-pcpu,+pmem |head
    
    Customizing the ps output format:    ps -eo uname,pid,start_time,time,args | head
   
    top Display all running process:    top
   
    kill pid terminate a process:  kill -9 2895
   
    Kill all the process named proc:    killall -9 firefox
    
    Kill all processes matching the pattern:   pkill -USR1 sample
    
    List stopped or background jobs, resume a stopped job in the background:    bg
   
    Brings the most recent job to foreground:  fg
